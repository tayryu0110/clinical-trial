DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

Below is a description of the variables recorded from the Mayo Clinic trial 
in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 
1984.  A total of 418 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during
that ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo 
controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data 
set participated in the randomized trial, and contain largely complete data. 
The additional 106 cases did not participate in the clinical trial, but 
consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.
Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so there 
are data here on an additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized 
participants. Missing data items are denoted by ".".  At least one space 
separates each variable in the .DAT file.  Censoring was due to liver 
transplantation for twenty-five subjects with the following case numbers: 
5, 105, 111, 120, 125, 158, 183, 241, 246, 247, 254, 263, 264, 265, 274, 
288, 291, 295, 297, 345, 361, 362, 375, 380, 383.


LIST OF VARIABLES:

Variable	Description
___________________________________________________________________________

N   	Case number.
X   	The number of days between registration and the earlier of
     	death, liver transplantation, or study analysis time in July, 1986.
D   	1 if X is time to death, 0 if time to censoring
Z1  	Treatment Code, 1 = D-penicillamine, 2 = placebo.
Z2  	Age in years. For the first 312 cases, age was calculated by
     	dividing the number of days between birth and study registration by 365.
Z3  	Sex, 0 = male, 1 = female.
Z4  	Presence of ascites, 0 = no, 1 = yes.
Z5  	Presence of hepatomegaly, 0 = no, 1 = yes.
Z6  	Presence of spiders 0 = no, 1 = Yes.
Z7  	Presence of edema, 0 = no edema and no diuretic therapy for
     	edema; 0.5 = edema present for which no diuretic therapy was given, or 
     	edema resolved with diuretic therapy; 1 = edema despite diuretic therapy
Z8  	Serum bilirubin, in mg/dl.
Z9  	Serum cholesterol, in mg/dl.
Z10 	Albumin, in gm/dl.
Z11 	Urine copper, in mg/day.
Z12 	Alkaline phosphatase, in U/liter.
Z13 	SGOT, in U/ml.
Z14 	Triglycerides, in mg/dl.
Z15 	Platelet count; coded value is number of platelets
     	per-cubic-milliliter of blood divided by 1000.
Z16 	Prothrombin time, in seconds.
Z17 	Histologic stage of disease, graded 1, 2, 3, or 4.
